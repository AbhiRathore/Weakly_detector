# Weakly_detector
Tensorflow implementation of "Learning Deep Features for Discriminative Localization"

![alt tag](https://github.com/jazzsaxmafia/Weakly_detector/blob/master/results/demo.main.jpg)

Object localization using only image-level annotation, without bounding box annotation.

* If you want to train the model using custom dataset, you need the pretrained VGG Network weights [[VGG](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5o40yxdA9PqOVI5dF9tN3NUc2c/view?usp=sharing)]. Please send me an email if you need it.

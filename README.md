Object localization using only image-level annotation, without bounding box annotation.

* If you want to train the model using custom dataset, you need the pretrained VGG Network weights [[VGG](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5o40yxdA9PqOVI5dF9tN3NUc2c/view?usp=sharing)], which is used in [[code](https://github.com/jazzsaxmafia/Weakly_detector/blob/master/src/train.caltech.py#L10)].
